Onboard the Pierre de Fermat, internet connectivity is limited. To get online sailors must visit a designated internet cabin to surf the web via a satellite uplink. Yet, this ship and the 80-person crew is an essential part of the internet's sprawling infrastructure: it repairs the vast network of undersea cables connecting the continents.

Running along the seabed are thousands of miles of high capacity, data-transporting pipes. From Malaysia to South Africa and Greenland to Canada, the fibres (literally and digitally) connect the world. When the cables break - caused by sharks, earthquakes and, most commonly, boats - it's the job of the Pierre de Fermat, of Orange Marine, and other similar vessels to reconnect them.

For every journey, bad weather, pirates, and deep murky waters stand in the way of a successful splicing.

As WIRED visits the ship, it's docked in Weymouth, South England, and is reloading in preparation for a job. "Where we're going now, in the North Sea, we will have three or four days to fix the cable" the captain, Guillaume Le Saux, tells WIRED. He's been in charge of submarine cable-fixing boats for almost a decade.

At the heart of Le Saux's boat is its cable, but in an age of machinery and automation, loading it is a decidedly manual task. Spooling from a warehouse – in this case owned by BT – on the side of the dock, the cable snakes its way onto the boat through a number of guiding loops and is fed through the ship until it reaches its core. At each stage it is overseen by watchful crew members.

The entirety of the 100-metre-long ship, which was completed and made its maiden voyage in 2014, is structured around its cable store room. With a capacity of 9,000km (5,592 miles) of cable, the central room (cable tongue) is filled by hand. For its 20-day journey into the North Sea, the boat is being restocked with just 9km (5.5 miles) of undersea connections, a feat that takes several hours to load.

Seven men are required in the cabling room to physically grab and guide the cable around the outside of the room. On the deck above them, more engineers feed the cable through the boat and inspect its internal fibres. Before the Pierre de Fermat sets sail it must ensure the cable is operational; the onboard crew physically cut the cable with a Stanley knife blade to inspect and then test its data-carrying capability. Willy Poulain, the ship's engineering leading, says onboard generators can produce 10,000 volts that are passed through a cable to ensure it is up to the job of transporting some of the world's internet traffic.

The process of reloading the ship is the start of its journey. Once it has navigated to the area of a reported cable disruption, the real work begins. The crew then have to find the damaged or broken cable. "Localisation of the fault is the hardest," says Poulain. For this, the ship's onboard giant robot is called upon.

Hector, a giant remotely-operated vehicle, is lowered to the sea floor (the bot's maximum depth is 2,000m) to retrieve the broken cable. The nine-tonne robot uses onboard cameras and claws, that are controlled by the crew, to grab the internet pipe from its location. "If we can't find the cable, most of the time it has been moved by a boat or displaced," Le Saux explains.

The breaks happen surprisingly frequently. "There's a cable fault somewhere in the world twice a week," Tim Stronge, vice president of Telegeography, which creates giant undersea cable maps, tells WIRED. He says the majority of cable breaks are caused by humans and happen in fishing areas where boats and trawlers accidentally snag or rip the light-carrying cables open. Although Stronge says it is not unheard of for storms and underwater earthquakes to cause faults.

For Le Saux, there are other things to worry about. Over lunch – those aboard the Pierre de Fermat can only have alcohol on Thursdays and Sundays – he says pirates have attacked boats in the past and he has seen thieves stealing parts of the cables that connect to land. ("It was from the beach side," he says. "The cable was not in service.") There's also the problem of animals in the sea: "We have seen shark bites in the cables in the past. When we have seen that we try to protect the cable with a metal tube."

All the elements add to a challenging job of repairing the subsea cables. Stronge adds: "There are actually a lot of cable breaks off the coast of the UK as well, as that's a heavily fished area. You don't hear about that so much as there are so many cables." Most cable breaks don't have much of an impact on the general availability of the internet. The largest countries connected to the internet are online through a number of cables and when one does get taken offline, the traffic is re-routed. However, in 2008, severed cables caused internet disruption for 70 per cent of the nationwide network in Egypt and India had 60 per cent of its networks disrupted.

Onboard the Orange Marine ship when a cable is retrieved by Hector, specialist teams of engineers are set to work. Within a repair room (which feels like a scientific laboratory) engineers lay the cable across two work benches and fix broken areas. They often add a new section of cable into the area which is broken or frayed. The process hasn't changed much in recent years, Poulain says. And nor is it likely to going forward.

"Where the technology will improve is in the factories and from the providers of the cables. The fibres are very high performance and the improvement is in the evolution of the fibres."
